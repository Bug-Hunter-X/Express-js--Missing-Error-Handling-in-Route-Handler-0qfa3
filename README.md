# Express.js: Missing Error Handling in Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling within route handlers.  The provided code lacks proper error handling for database operations, resulting in unexpected behavior and unhelpful error messages for the client.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, illustrates best practices for handling errors gracefully and providing informative responses to the client.

## Bug Description
The original code omits crucial error handling mechanisms.  If a database query fails or if a requested resource is not found, the server either crashes silently (internal error) or sends a generic and unhelpful message to the user.

## Solution
The improved version incorporates comprehensive error handling using try-catch blocks and explicit status codes. The solution checks for errors at every stage and sends appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) along with informative error messages to the client, ensuring that users receive clear feedback in different scenarios.
